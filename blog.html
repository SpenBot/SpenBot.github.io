					<p> We only recieved a <span class="blogBold">very brief exposure to Redux</span> in GA. It’s got a pretty steep learning curve, and I didn’t really get a chance to work with it. But I went to a meetup last night where the <span class="blogBold">presenters walked us through some real-life implementations</span>, and its really re-spraked my interest. </p>
					<p> I'm feeling much more comfortable with it now, and am <span class="blogBold">planning on implementing it in my next personal project</span>, which will be an camera-gear sharing application. </p>

					<p>	The GA program includes a “Student Spotlight” event, which is essentially a reverse job fair. Very cool! Today I was <span class="blogBold">given the OK for all required materials to officially begin my job search</span>, which took a ton of time and effort.</p>
					<p>	The <span class="blogBold">main purpose of this blog is to document coding activities and achievements as a developer</span> and is meant to keep myself accountable to continue my studies. But job searching and networking will be a huge part of my life for a while, so its worth an occasional mention here.</p>

					<p>	I figured I earned a few days break from living and breathing code after graduation. Coming back to it after a long weekend was when I truly realized how challenging it would be to retain the knowledge I learned!</p>
					<p>	Its an amazing privilege to be immersed in such a rich environment for 8-10 hours a day with equally enthusiastic peers. But its a real concern that the information attained in such an intensive setting can slip away just as easily. On top of that, now you're left on your own. Its a real challenge, so <span class="blogBold">my mission now is to revisit and solidify the frameworks and technologies</span> we covered during the course.</p>

					<img src="./images/blogpost-chat.png" alt="chatroom img" class="blogImg">

					<p>	The most difficult <span class="blogBold">challenge of this project was understanding the complex data flow</span> when introducing web-sockets to a React App (which already has a pretty confusing data structure). My initial plan was to make a chat room application for my thesis. But after a few days, I still had nothing and was extremely confused as to how my entire backend should function. I just couldn’t get the user functionality to work...</p>
					<p>	I was just about to ditch the whole idea, when I decided to forget users for a minute to play around with simple add/sub buttons with sockets. It worked! It made sense why it was working! And that was the spark that led me to just make a game instead. And in the end, <span class="blogBold">focusing on 2 users helped me get a better grasp on web-sockets</span> than doing a larger chat app.</p>
