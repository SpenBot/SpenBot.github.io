like a little heart rate monitor or something?

I should probably draw my own mail and smartphone icons...

how do I make the grid everywhere but the text?

also, how to add the measuring lines? because those are cool. Also, where do I put them?

I kinda like the idea of like old medical records as well.

I don't love the grid

I like the diamond logo, or cynlinder tower, or bridge, or sonar

The featured title might be a little too high
